So let's say you have a nice c++ `project` which has a few dependencies. You might want to add those to you cmake file using something like

```cmake
find_package(LIBRARY)
target_link_libraries(project PRIVATE ${LIBRARY})
```

but then what to do if the linking fails? 
Usually you get an `undefined symbol` error, with the symbol given in some mangled string. 
You can unmangle the string, and check out what symbol you are missing, by using 
```bash
c++filt mangledstring
```

There are two types of linking, static and dynamic. 
In the static case you link against `.a` files, and the contents of that file are included at link time. 
In the case of dynamic linking a pointer to an .so file being linked.

To check out the list of linked files use
```bash
ldd filename
```
or 
```bash
readelf --dynamic filename
```
To have a look at the symbols defined in a file use
```bash
nm -gDC filename
```
The c++ [ABI](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libstdc++/manual/abi.html) has changed with time, which might cause some problems...
