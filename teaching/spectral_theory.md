Spectral Theory and Spectral Practices
========================================
I've been invited to teach a minicourse on Finite Element approximations of eigenvalues problems at the University of Edinburgh, UK, by Prof. [Kaibo Hu](https://kaibohu.github.io/). The course was supported by the [ERC Starting Grant GeoFEM (Geometric Finite Element Methods)](https://kaibohu.github.io/geofem/).
The courses composes of 4 lectures, each lasting one hour and of practical exercises making use of the finite element library [Firedrake](https://www.firedrakeproject.org/).

In this short course, we explore finite element discretisations of eigenvalue problems involving non-normal operators, with a focus on the advection-diffusion equation as a guiding example. We begin by revisiting fundamental spectral notions—self-adjointness, normality, spectra, and pseudospectra—with particular emphasis on how an operator spectrum informs us about the physical behaviour of the time-dependent PDEs. The core of the course is devoted to the classical analysis of finite element approximations: we present in detail the Bramble-Osborn results for non-self-adjoint eigenvalue problems, including full proofs, and discuss their implications for convergence and approximation quality. For comparison, we also review the celebrated Babuška-Osborn theory in the self-adjoint case. If time permits, we will conclude with a discussion on iterative solvers and preconditioning strategies tailored to non-normal eigenvalue problems. The course requires basic background in functional analysis and finite element methods.
